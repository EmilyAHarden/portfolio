				<h2>About Emily
				</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="bodytext">
				<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emily has been interested in public relations, marketing, advertising and event management since a very young age, even if she didn’t know what it was called yet. She started editing videos in the 7th grade for herself and friends. She even started event managing since then too, as a stage manager for plays or planning elaborate birthday parties for friends.
				<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By acting on stage, she worked on her public speaking skills and acting allowed her creativity to flow. Public speaking and management skills contributed to her placement as a member and president of Student Union Activities Board. With this organization, she planned events, handled team management on a small and large scale and worked on membership retention.
				<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She earned two internships throughout her time at OSU, one at Leonardo’s Children’s Museum as a marketing intern and one at ONEGas as a communications intern. Both helped her to learn more about the professional side of marketing and communications as she appeared on local television, planned events and had written work that appeared in bi-monthly newsletters.
				<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she graduated from OSU, she worked as a Manager in Training and eventual Community Director for Weidner Apartment Homes where she trained and led a team of 6 associates as well as maintained financials on a multi-million dollar property.
				<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In March 2017 she was fortunate enough to be officially offered a position as a junior board member and ultimately board member for the Tulsa Day Center for the Homeless, which she served in for two years and helped plan events and work on social media marketing.
				<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In her free time, she loves to travel and spend time with her friends and her dogs. Check out some travel highlights and her porfolio above. 
			<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, she has begun working on learning more about HTML, CSS and JavaScript, all of which were used to make this site!
			<br>Please feel free to contact Emily and she would be happy to connect with you!
